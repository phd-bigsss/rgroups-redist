Over the past few decades, cross-national studies on social class and redistributive preferences have predominantly focused on individual class positions (Lindh & McCall, 2020). Recently, however, a growing body of research has begun to address how the class composition of social networks is associated with redistributive preferences (Lee, 2023; Lindh, Andersson, & Völker, 2021; Otero & Mendoza, 2023; Paskov & Weisstanner, 2022). Existing studies have generally examined cross-class contacts or overall class profiles of social networks. In contrast, this study explicitly focuses on class-based network segregation, defined as the proportion of within-class network contacts relative to individual class position. Social classes often form segregated networks according to the homophily principle, whereby individuals have higher chances of forming social ties with others who share similar characteristics (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001; Otero, Völker, & Rözer, 2021). Prior cross-national comparisons indicate that class differences in social participation and access to social resources increase in countries with higher economic inequality, reinforcing the social distance between classes (Otero, Völker, Rözer, & Mollenhorst, 2024; Pichler & Wallace, 2009). Previous evidence has also indicated that class-based network segregation—operationalized as the relative proportion of similar-class contacts—is negatively associated with attachment to society in contexts of high income inequality (Otero, Völker, Rözer, & Mollenhorst, 2022). Yet, we know little about how homogeneous class-based networks are related to redistributive preferences and whether this relationship has similar implications for working and service classes (Paskov & Weisstanner, 2022). Theoretically, a higher share of within-class ties is expected to reinforce class-based interests, as homogeneous networks represent one of the micro-processes that may shape how individuals experience the class structure (Wright & Cho, 1992). Therefore, this study explicitly examines how the relationship between class-based homogeneity and redistributive preferences may differ according to individual class position.

Furthermore, recent cross-national studies have explored how contextual factors moderate the relationship between class profiles in social networks and attitudes toward inequality, specifically highlighting welfare state redistribution as a relevant country-level moderator (Lindh & Andersson, 2024). Thus, there remains a notable gap regarding the moderating role of economic inequality in shaping the association between class-based network segregation and redistributive preferences. In this study, I conceptualize income inequality as the prevailing distributional context of economic resources and welfare within a society—the conditions under which political debates unfold and political attitudes are formed (Palme, 2006). Specifically, I refer to post-tax and transfer income inequality (UNU-WIDER, 2023). Prior research on class and political attitudes suggests that income inequality is critical for understanding how class-based inequalities—manifested as socioeconomic and political distances—translate into redistributive demands (Curtis & Andersen, 2015; Edlund & Lindh, 2015). A consistent finding from this literature is that in high-inequality contexts, the advantaged classes express greater concern about income inequality and consequently show higher support for redistribution, whereas redistributive demands of the socioeconomically disadvantaged appear relatively stable regardless of inequality levels (Dimick, Rueda, & Stegmueller, 2017; Sachweh & Sthamer, 2019; Wiesner, 2025). This phenomenon may be partly explained by advantaged classes’ heightened awareness of inequality’s negative externalities, such as crime or social unrest. Moreover, advantaged classes might experience increased concern about the shrinking opportunity structure, perceiving greater risks of downward mobility, which may amplify their support for redistribution as a protective measure (Hertel & Groh-Samberg, 2019). On the other hand, income inequality has been consistently linked to patterns of social participation and the social distance between classes. In highly unequal societies, upper classes tend to be more socially active and maintain more diverse networks, whereas lower classes often experience greater exclusion from social participation and resources (Lancee & Van de Werfhorst, 2012; Otero et al., 2024; Pichler & Wallace, 2009).

Against this theoretical and empirical background, this study addresses two main research questions. First, to what extent is the association between class-based network segregation and redistributive preferences conditional on social class? Second, to what extent does income inequality moderate the class-specific association between network homogeneity and redistributive preferences? To address these questions, I use cross-sectional data from the 2017 International Social Survey Program (ISSP), covering individuals from 31 countries. This dataset provides comprehensive cross-national comparative information on social networks, social class, and attitudes toward redistribution. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, it is important to clarify that while the associations and moderating effects observed may indicate theoretically relevant relationships, causality cannot be established. Consequently, causal interpretations should be approached with caution, and the findings should be considered as indicative of patterns consistent with theoretical expectations rather than definitive causal evidence.
