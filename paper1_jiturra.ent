excluded

``It

macro:->Supplementary
analyses
employing
alternative
income
inequality
measures
show
that
the
results
are
robust
when
using
the
Inter-decile
(D9/D1)
and
the
Top
10/Bottom
50
ratios.
Additionally,
I
classified
countries
into
low,
middle-low,
middle,
middle-high,
and
high-income
inequality
groups
based
on
quintiles
according
to
the
Gini
index.
Hence,
I
used
country-fixed
effects
regressions
to
control
for
the
cross-country
differences
and
observed
and
unobserved
societal
characteristics.
The
results
are
consistent
with
the
multilevel
estimations.

employed
the
Restricted
Maximum

(REML)
method
because
it
adjusts
the
estimation
of
standard

for
small

and
provides
better

of
